# 🚀 Golang Web Frameworks Overview

Welcome to the **Golang Web Frameworks Overview** project! This repository presents a curated collection and comparison of the top Golang web frameworks. It’s designed to help developers—whether beginners or experienced—choose the most suitable framework for building APIs, web services, or full-stack applications.

---

## 📌 Project Purpose

Golang (or Go) is a modern compiled language known for its performance, simplicity, and concurrency model. While Go’s `net/http` package is powerful, building production-grade applications from scratch can be time-consuming. Web frameworks simplify this process by offering ready-to-use tools, patterns, and performance improvements.

This project provides detailed insights into popular Go frameworks, helping you select the one that best fits your project’s needs.

## 🔝 Frameworks Covered

1. **Gin** – Lightweight, fast, and great for REST APIs
2. **Beego** – Full-stack MVC framework with built-in tools
3. **Echo** – High-performance, extensible framework
4. **Go Kit** – Toolkit for microservice architecture
5. **Fasthttp** – Ultra-fast HTTP engine
6. **Revel** – Full-featured framework for web apps
7. **Fiber** – Express-inspired and built on Fasthttp
8. **Buffalo** – Convention-based rapid development
9. **Chi** – Lightweight router with middleware support
10. **Goyave** – Clean, scalable, and standards-driven
